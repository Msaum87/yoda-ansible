# davrods-vhost.conf

# davrods is a mod_dav WebDAV provider. Configuration directives for davrods
# should be placed in a <Location> block.

# Below we provide an example vhost configuration that enables davrods using
# its default options.

        # davrods implements multiple dav providers, use either:

        # - davrods-locallock (recommended): WebDAV class 2 provider, uses a DBM lock database local to this webserver
